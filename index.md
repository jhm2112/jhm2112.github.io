Welcome! This is where I update my work related information. If you'd like a quick overview of me, take a look at my website, specially the [***Job Experience***](job-experience.md)  section.

## Short Bio
I'm a 25-year-old Mexican-American with a B.S. degree in Computer Science from UC San Diego, one of the top schools in the nation for CS. I also have experience in  jobs not related to tech. I grew up in Mexico and decided to move to the U.S. for college, aiming to build a new life and career. During my life, I have faced significant challenges due to a severe health condition that worsened with age. This condition made my personal and work life different than most, but it also taught me the importance of resilience and staying focused on learning, working and enjoying life.

Even with these challenges, I maintained a strong GPA in college and developed solid technical skills, particularly in C++, Java, JavaScript and SQL, topics like web development, databases, computer security, data structures and algorithms. I also have a good instict for fixing software and hardware issues (and googling them) After graduating, I took some time to focus on seeking medical help and recovering my health. After recovering, I stared working in various roles, including as a cashier,cook and as a game developer in  my free time. I've been gaining more valuable experience as a teammate and customer service provider and I'm looking for opportunities that better fit my lifestyle and interests. Iâ€™m fluent in both Spanish and English, learn new technologies and tasks quickly, and consistently performed well in technical assessments during my time as an undergraduate.

**Please consider giving me a chance, and thank you for your time!**
