Welcome! This is where I update my work related information. If you'd like a quick overview of me, take a look at my website, specially the [***Job Experience***](job-experience.md)  section.

## Short Bio
I'm a 25-year-old Mexican-American with a B.S. degree in Computer Science from UC San Diego, one of the top schools in the nation for CS. I received a well-rounded education in the fundamentals of CS theory and hands on experiences in group software development in areas like mobile, web and dabatases.

I maintained a strong GPA in college and developed solid technical skills, particularly in C++, Java, JavaScript and SQL, topics like web development, databases, computer security, data structures and algorithms. I also have a good instict for fixing software and hardware issues (and googling them). I'm looking for opportunities that better fit my lifestyle and interests. Iâ€™m fluent in both Spanish and English, learn new technologies and tasks quickly, and consistently performed well in technical assessments during my time as an undergraduate.

**Thank you for your time!**
